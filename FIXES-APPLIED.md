# Redux Serialization Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Redux Serialization Errors
**Problem**: WebSocket objects were being stored in Redux state, causing multiple serialization warnings:
```
A non-serializable value was detected in an action, in the path: `payload`. Value: WebSocket
```

**Solution**: 
- Updated `websocketSlice.ts` to remove WebSocket object storage
- Changed to use `connectionStatus: string` instead of storing the WebSocket object
- Updated `websocket.ts` service to use the new Redux actions properly

**Files Modified**:
- `src/store/slices/websocketSlice.ts` - Removed `setConnection` action and WebSocket object from state
- `src/services/websocket.ts` - Updated to use `setConnectionStatus` instead of storing WebSocket object

### 2. Database RLS Policy Issues
**Problem**: Row Level Security (RLS) policies were blocking user profile creation during signup.

**Solution**: 
- Created improved database setup script with proper RLS policies
- Added error handling in trigger function to prevent auth failures
- Made policies more permissive for authenticated users

**Files Modified**:
- `database/setup-fixed.sql` - Updated with proper RLS policies and error handling

## Current Status

✅ **Metro Bundler**: Running successfully without errors
✅ **TypeScript Compilation**: No errors in any source files  
✅ **Redux Store**: No more serialization warnings
✅ **WebSocket Service**: Properly integrated with Redux without storing non-serializable objects
✅ **Authentication**: Should work properly with updated database policies

## Next Steps

1. **Apply Database Updates**: Run the SQL script in `database/setup-fixed.sql` in your Supabase dashboard
2. **Test Authentication**: Try signing up a new user - should work without RLS policy errors
3. **Test App Features**: All three modes (Auto, Manual, Off) should work without Redux errors
4. **Connect to Pi**: When your Raspberry Pi is running, the WebSocket connection should work seamlessly

## Usage Instructions

1. Scan the QR code with Expo Go
2. Sign up or sign in 
3. App should load without any Redux serialization errors in the console
4. WebSocket will attempt to connect to Pi (expected to fail if Pi not running)
5. All mode switching and controls should work properly

The app is now ready for full testing with a clean console log!
