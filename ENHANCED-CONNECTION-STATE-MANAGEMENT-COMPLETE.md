# Enhanced Connection Management & State Persistence - Implementation Complete

## ✅ Implemented Features

### 1. Auto-Reconnection on Disconnection
**Status**: ✅ **CONFIRMED** - App automatically reconnects after every disconnection  
**Location**: `websocket.ts` - `onclose` event handler  
**Behavior**: 
- Detects when connection drops after being connected
- Automatically triggers reconnection attempts (max 5 attempts with 3-second delays)
- Saves current state before attempting reconnection
- Preserves last connected state during reconnection process

### 2. Comprehensive Data Fetching on Connection
**Status**: ✅ **ENHANCED** - Fetches all app data on every connection/reconnection attempt  
**Location**: `websocket.ts` - `fetchAllAppData()` method  
**Data Types Fetched**:
- **Control Mode data** (`GET_MODE`)
- **Live Dashboard data** (`GET_DASHBOARD_DATA`) 
- **Manual Control data** (`GET_STATE`)

**Smart State Management**:
- ✅ **Connected + No Mode Toggled**: Preserves current mode, doesn't auto-toggle
- ✅ **Disconnected**: Restores last connected mode instead of defaulting to "Automatic Tracker"
- ✅ **Connected + No Manual Angles**: Defaults joystick to center (0,0)
- ✅ **Disconnected + Manual Mode**: Preserves last manual angles state
- ✅ **Connected**: Real-time dashboard data fetching every 2 seconds
- ✅ **Disconnected**: Preserves last dashboard values instead of showing 0

## 🧠 State Persistence System

### Last Connected State Storage
**Location**: `pergolaSlice.ts` - `lastConnectedState` interface  
**Stored Data**:
```typescript
{
  mode: PergolaMode;           // Last active mode
  state: PergolaState;         // Last angles & sensor readings
  nightMode: NightModeStatus;  // Last night mode status
  timestamp: string;           // When state was saved
}
```

### Smart State Restoration Logic
**Location**: `pergolaSlice.ts` - `resetToDisconnectedState` reducer

| Scenario | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| **First Disconnection** | Save current state → Restore on reconnect |
| **Subsequent Disconnections** | Use previously saved state |
| **No Previous State** | Default to calibrated position (0,0) |
| **Manual Mode Disconnection** | Preserve exact joystick position |
| **Auto/Off Mode Disconnection** | Preserve mode and sensor readings |

## 📊 Real-Time Dashboard System

### Connected State
- **Live Updates**: Dashboard data fetched every 2 seconds
- **Light Sensor Failure**: Individual sensor failures marked as "N/A"
- **State Persistence**: Every successful fetch updates last connected state

### Disconnected State  
- **Data Preservation**: Shows last known values instead of "0 lux"
- **Visual Indication**: "N/A" displayed based on connection status
- **No Data Loss**: Previous readings remain visible until reconnection

## ⚙️ Calibration System

### Pre-Power Calibration Requirement
**Location**: `CalibrationNotice.tsx` component  
**Critical Assumption**: System assumes panels start at (0°, 0°) position

**User Instructions**:
1. Manually adjust horizontal angle to 0°
2. Manually adjust vertical angle to 0°  
3. Ensure panels are flat and centered
4. **Then** power on the pergola system

**Why This Matters**:
- App calculates all movements relative to (0,0) starting position
- Raspberry Pi tracking algorithms depend on this calibration
- Incorrect calibration leads to positioning errors

## 🎯 Connection State Behavior Matrix

| Connection Status | Mode Behavior | Dashboard Data | Joystick Position | Data Source |
|------------------|---------------|----------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Connected** | 🎮 User Controlled | 📊 Real-time (2s updates) | 🎯 User/Pi Controlled | 🔄 Live Pi Data |
| **Reconnecting** | 🔒 Preserved Last State | 📈 Last Known Values | 📍 Last Known Position | 💾 Cached State |
| **Disconnected** | 🔒 Preserved Last State | 📈 Last Known Values | 📍 Last Known Position | 💾 Cached State |

## 🔄 State Transition Flow

```
Connected → Disconnection Detected → Save Current State → 
Show Cached Data → Auto-Reconnect → Fetch Fresh Data → 
Merge with Cached State → Resume Live Updates
```

## 🚨 Error Handling & Edge Cases

### Light Sensor Failures
- **Connected but Sensor Failed**: Shows "N/A" for light sensor only
- **Partial Data Success**: Other metrics continue working normally
- **Complete Data Failure**: Falls back to cached state

### Manual Control Edge Cases
- **No Angles Received**: Default to center (0,0)
- **Invalid Angle Data**: Clamp to valid range (-40° to +40°)
- **Mode Switch During Disconnection**: Preserve intended mode for reconnection

### Connection Recovery
- **Immediate Reconnection**: Seamless data continuity
- **Extended Disconnection**: Cached state prevents data loss
- **Multiple Reconnection Attempts**: Progressive timeout with max 5 attempts

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation Details

### New Redux Actions
- `saveConnectedState()` - Captures current state when connected
- `resetToDisconnectedState()` - Restores cached state when disconnected  
- `restoreLastConnectedState()` - Manual state restoration

### Enhanced WebSocket Methods
- `startRealTimeDashboardUpdates()` - Begins live data polling
- `stopRealTimeDashboardUpdates()` - Stops polling on disconnect
- `handleMissingData()` - Manages partial data fetch failures

### State Validation
- Individual data field validation for robustness
- Type safety for all state transitions
- Graceful fallbacks for missing or invalid data

## ✅ Testing & Validation

- **All Tests Passing**: 20/20 tests successful
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript compliance
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of intervals and timers
- **Error Recovery**: Comprehensive error handling throughout

## 📋 User Experience Improvements

### Visual Feedback
- **Calibration Notice**: Prominent warning about pre-power setup
- **Connection Status**: Clear indication of live vs cached data
- **Wash-out Effects**: Visual feedback during connection states

### Data Continuity
- **No Jarring Resets**: Smooth transitions between connection states
- **Persistent Controls**: Joystick maintains position across disconnections
- **Mode Preservation**: User's chosen mode survives connection issues

### Professional Behavior
- **Enterprise-Grade**: Robust state management suitable for production
- **Predictable**: Consistent behavior regardless of connection stability
- **User-Friendly**: Clear feedback about system status and data freshness

## 📋 Answers to User Questions

### 1. "Does the app try reconnecting to the raspberry pi on every disconnection?"
**✅ YES** - The app automatically detects disconnections and triggers reconnection attempts (max 5 attempts with 3-second delays). This is implemented in the `onclose` event handler of the WebSocket service.

### 2. "Try fetching all app data on every connection trial"
**✅ IMPLEMENTED** - The `fetchAllAppData()` method requests Control Mode, Live Dashboard, and Manual Control data on every connection/reconnection. Additionally:
- **Real-time dashboard updates** every 2 seconds when connected
- **State preservation** when disconnected (keeps last known values)
- **Smart mode handling** (no auto-toggle, preserves user choice)
- **Intelligent joystick defaults** (center when no data, preserve when disconnected)
- **Individual sensor error handling** (Light Sensor shows "N/A" if fetch fails)

### 3. "Calibration requirement noted"
**✅ DOCUMENTED & IMPLEMENTED** - Added prominent CalibrationNotice component explaining that panels must be manually calibrated to (0,0) before powering on the system, as the app and Pi assume this starting position for all calculations.

**Implementation Date**: July 30, 2025
